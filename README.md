# Typing Speed and Accuracy Test Project
This is my first programming based project. <br>
<ul>
<li>Typing speed and accuracy test is a way to measure how quickly and accurately an individual can type. It assesses your ability to type words, phrases, or sentences within a given time limit and provides an evaluation of your performance. </li>

<li>Typing speed is typically measured in words per minute (WPM) or characters per minute (CPM). It indicates how many words or characters you can type within a minute. </li>

<li>Accuracy measures how many errors you make while typing. It is usually expressed as a percentage (%), indicating the ratio of correct characters typed to the total number of characters typed </li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color: blue">How to take the test?</h2>
<ol>
<li>To take a typing speed and accuracy test, you are usually provided with a text passage that you need to type. </li>
<li>The test starts as you begin typing, and the timer is set to track the time it takes to complete the task. </li>
<li>Once you finish typing the passage, the test calculates your typing speed and accuracy based on the number of words or characters you typed correctly within the allotted time. </li>
<li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/SajjadHossainSoykot/Typing-Speed-Accuracy-Test-Project/raw/master/TypingTest.exe">TypingTest.exe<a> file. </li>
<li>Run the file and follow the instructions. </li>
</ol>
