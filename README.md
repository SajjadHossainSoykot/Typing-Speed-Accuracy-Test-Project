# Typing-Speed-Accuracy-Test-Project
Typing speed and accuracy test is a way to measure how quickly and accurately an individual can type. It assesses your ability to type words, phrases, or sentences within a given time limit and provides an evaluation of your performance. <br>

Typing speed is typically measured in words per minute (WPM) or characters per minute (CPM). It indicates how many words or characters you can type within a minute. <br>

Accuracy measures how many errors you make while typing. It is usually expressed as a percentage (%), indicating the ratio of correct characters typed to the total number of characters typed <br>

<h2 style="color: blue">How to take the test?</h2>
To take a typing speed and accuracy test, you are usually provided with a text passage that you need to type. The test starts as you begin typing, and the timer is set to track the time it takes to complete the task. <br>

Once you finish typing the passage, the test calculates your typing speed and accuracy based on the number of words or characters you typed correctly within the allotted time. <br>
